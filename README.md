Use SIFT to determine key points and match with other image

The objective is to use the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect key points in an image and analyze how transformations affect key point matching.

Extract Key Points and Descriptors – Use the SIFT algorithm to detect key points and compute descriptors for the given image.
Modify the Image – Apply transformations such as rotation, scaling, and cropping.
Detect Key Points in Modified Images – Recompute key points and descriptors for the transformed images.
Match Key Points – Compare and match key points between the original and modified images.

Dependencies: pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
